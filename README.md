Notes from recommendation-system implementation

<h3>What it is?</h3>

My implementation of the tutorial by Agnes Johannsdottir 
from https://cambridgespark.com/content/tutorials/implementing-your-own-recommender-systems-in-Python/index.html
supplied by my own notes and comments. The tutorial dataset is a well-known MovieLens database 
of (among others) movie ratings created by GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.
